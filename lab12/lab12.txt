	1.  Source: 64.233.169.104(confirmed with ip addr show and serial number 126)
	  	Destination: 192.168.1.100

2. Does the Total Length field include the IP header plus IP payload, or just the IP
payload?
	 Yes, ip header and payload
	  Total Length: 298
	  Header Length: 20 bytes (5) 
	  Tcp header : 20 bytes
	  Tcp payload : 258 bytes
	  Total : 298 bytes

3. How does the value of the Identification field change or stay the same for different
packets? For instance, does it hold the same value for all packets in a TCP connection or
does it differ for each packet? Is it the same in both directions? Can you see any pattern if
the value does change?
	  No. different fragments belonging to the same IPv4 packet are identified by having "the same" "identification" value.
	  The values are not same in both direction.
	  The values change they are incrementing.

4. What is the initial value of the TTL field for packets sent from your computer? Is it the
maximum possible value, or some lower value?
	   maximum TTL value is 255
	   Time to live: 50


5. How can you tell from looking at a packet that it has not been fragmented? Most often
IP packets in normal operation are not fragmented. But the receiver must have a way to be
sure. Hint: you may need to read your text to confirm a guess.
  	 .1.. .... .... .... = Don't fragment: Set

6. What is the length of the IP Header and how is this encoded in the header length field?
Hint: notice that only 4 bits are used for this field, as the version takes up the other 4 bits of
the byte. You may guess and check your text.
